# trails code (web scraping)
This code uses the BeautifulSoup library to extract the links in https://www.traillink.com/.

In this code i wrote a function so by changing the city/state name get the trails data of that city/state

This code uses the "a" tag in the HTML code to help extract all the links that are embedded in the web page.
